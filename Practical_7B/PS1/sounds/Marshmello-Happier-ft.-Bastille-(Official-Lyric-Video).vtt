00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:07.165
Lately I have been thinking

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.856
I want you to be happier

00:00:09.914 --> 00:00:11.933
I want you to be happier

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.790
When the morning come

00:00:14.804 --> 00:00:17.093
When we see what we′ve become

00:00:17.143 --> 00:00:18.202
In the cold light of day

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.989
We are a flame in the wind not
the fire that we′ve begun

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.968
Every argument

00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:26.125
Every word we can′t take back

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:27.910
Cause with all that has happened

00:00:27.978 --> 00:00:31.527
I think that we both know
the way that story ends

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.110
Then only for a minute

00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:38.581
I want to change my mind

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:42.290
Cause this just don′t feel right to me

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.599
I wanna raise your spirit is

00:00:45.643 --> 00:00:48.422
I want to see you smile

00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:51.771
Know that means I will have to leave

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.642
Know that means I will have to leave

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.939
Lately I have been thinking

00:01:04.983 --> 00:01:10.332
I want you to be happier

00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:12.197
When the evevning falls

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:13.960
And I am left there with my thougts

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:17.035
And the image of you being
with someone else

00:01:17.057 --> 00:01:19.856
Well It is eating me up inside

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.659
But we ran our course

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:23.948
We pretended We are okay

00:01:24.002 --> 00:01:25.751
Now if we jump together

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:30.024
At least we can swing far away
from the wreck we made

00:01:30.078 --> 00:01:33.617
Then only for a minute

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:35.842
I want to change my mind

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:39.407
Cause this just don′t feel right to me

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:43.306

00:01:45.945 --> 00:01:49.734
Know that means I will have to leave

00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:10.644
So I will go

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:13.137
